# About WeDance

WeDance is a non-profit open source international dance community. Our mission is to unite dancers all over the world. Our vision: you can go to any city in any country and find events and dancers for every taste and color. Our strategy think globally, act locally. It all starts with the local community.

We are dancers, we set an example for society, which neither religion, nor goverment, nor science can do.

We are building a society where each person is a brother or a sister, a friend and is ready to help. Here you can get help and help others, we love everyone who is with us. It's difficult to get inside, but when you get inside, you get warmth and care. We have a strict security guard, we create a safe place where it is cozy, warm and comfortable. Where you can know what is happening and when, with whom you can meet to dance, with whom you can go to the festival, with whom you can spend the night and not be afraid for your safety.

We do not like violence, bullying, humiliation, advertising, pornography and spam. We are creative, delicate, fragile natures. We have a framework, and in this regard, everything is very strict. Reputation is above all, do not poop into the well from which you drink tomorrow. Respect your brothers and sisters, them and their culture and history. Look for a common language and reconciliation, ways to achieve a win-win situation. We have a boomerang principle (have you watched the Pay forward movie?) - help without remorse and it will return, we are not looking for self-interest.

We inspire, it's easy with us. Itâ€™s free and open souce.
